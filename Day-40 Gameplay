# Example input for testing
X, Y = 50, 24

# Calculate the time spent on the first Y minutes watched at 2x speed
time_at_2x_speed = Y // 2

# Calculate the time spent on the remaining part at normal speed
time_at_normal_speed = X - Y

# Calculate the total time spent watching the movie
total_time = time_at_2x_speed + time_at_normal_speed

# Output the result
print(total_time)
